pico-8 52-card game

Deadwood calculations were tricky. Implemented a tree where each leaf holds a non-overlapping set of melds which is then used to find the hand combination with the fewest deadwood points. This is used both for the player and the AI (especially when deciding what move to make), and at the end game scoring.
